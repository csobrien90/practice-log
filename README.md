# Practice Log

*This is a simple web application - built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP/MySQL - that allows users to track time on a given task (such as practicing a musical instrument) and view a log of their past sessions. This project is in partial fulfillment of the Code Louisville JavaScript course (September - November 2021).*

## JavaScript Features

- Use fetch() to retrieve data from an external API
- Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file - you must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that it’s being saved/persisted
- Post to an external API and show that it has saved/persisted (use Amazon S3’s API to upload a file to an AWS S3 bucket)
- Create and use a function that accepts two or more parameters, calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
- Implement a regular expression to ensure consistent email address format and password complexity
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (set the current time and display the time since - like a stopwatch)
